# Server Connectivity Checker - Complete Package

## What You Have

I've created a complete Python application for checking SSH connectivity to servers. Here's what's included:

### üìÅ Main Application
- **`server_connectivity_checker.py`** - The complete application (346 lines of robust Python code)

### üìã Documentation  
- **`README_ServerChecker.md`** - Complete usage guide with examples
- **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step deployment instructions for your workplace
- **`PACKAGE_SUMMARY.md`** - This overview file

### üìÑ Sample Files
- **`sample_servers.txt`** - Example text file format
- **`sample_servers.csv`** - Example CSV file format  
- **`test_servers.txt`** - Basic test file

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Multiple Input Formats**: Text files, CSV, Excel (.xlsx/.xls)  
‚úÖ **Concurrent Testing**: Multi-threaded for fast results  
‚úÖ **Detailed Reporting**: Status codes, timing, error messages  
‚úÖ **Flexible Output**: Console display + optional file reports  
‚úÖ **SSH Authentication**: Tests actual login capability  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS  
‚úÖ **No Dependencies**: Core functionality uses only Python standard library  

## Quick Start

1. Copy `server_connectivity_checker.py` to your work computer
2. Create a server list file (text, CSV, or Excel)
3. Run: `python3 server_connectivity_checker.py your_servers.txt`

## Status Codes Explained

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| SUCCESS | ‚úÖ Server is accessible and you can log in |
| AUTH_FAILED | ‚ö†Ô∏è Server is reachable but login failed (SSH keys/permissions issue) |
| DNS_FAILED | ‚ùå Hostname doesn't exist or can't be resolved |
| PORT_CLOSED | ‚ùå Server exists but SSH port 22 is blocked |
| TIMEOUT | ‚è±Ô∏è Connection attempt timed out |

## Example Output

```
Checking connectivity to 5 servers...
‚úì [1/5] web01.company.com     SUCCESS      (1.23s)
‚ö† [2/5] web02.company.com     AUTH_FAILED  (2.45s)  
‚úó [3/5] old-server.com        DNS_FAILED   (0.12s)
‚úì [4/5] db01.company.com      SUCCESS      (0.89s)
‚è± [5/5] slow-server.com       TIMEOUT      (10.00s)

SUMMARY:
  SUCCESS     : 2 (40.0%)
  AUTH_FAILED : 1 (20.0%) 
  DNS_FAILED  : 1 (20.0%)
  TIMEOUT     : 1 (20.0%)
```

## What This Tool Does

1. **Reads server lists** from text files, CSV files, or Excel spreadsheets
2. **Tests SSH connectivity** to each server concurrently 
3. **Checks DNS resolution** - can the hostname be found?
4. **Tests port accessibility** - is SSH port 22 open?
5. **Attempts SSH authentication** - can you actually log in?
6. **Provides detailed reports** with timing and error information
7. **Generates output files** for documentation and tracking

## Workplace Benefits

- **Quick Infrastructure Audits**: Check hundreds of servers in minutes
- **Access Verification**: Confirm your SSH keys work across environments  
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify connectivity vs authentication issues
- **Documentation**: Generate reports for compliance and tracking
- **Automation**: Integrate into monitoring scripts and cron jobs

## Ready to Deploy

The application is production-ready with:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper timeout management  
- Concurrent processing for speed
- Detailed logging and reporting
- Professional command-line interface
- Full documentation and examples

Simply copy the files to your work environment and start checking your servers!
