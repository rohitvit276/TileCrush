# Enhanced Server Connectivity Checker - Complete Feature Summary

## What's New: Username/Password Authentication

Your server connectivity checker has been enhanced with comprehensive authentication options.

## New Usage Options

### 1. Interactive Mode (Easiest)
```bash
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py servers.txt --interactive
```
- Prompts for username and password
- Secure password input (hidden)
- Works across all servers in the list

### 2. Specify Username + Password Auth
```bash
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py servers.txt --username admin --password-auth
```
- Uses specified username
- Prompts for password securely
- Good for scripting with known usernames

### 3. Password Auth Only
```bash
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py servers.txt --password-auth
```
- Prompts for both username and password
- Flexible for different scenarios

### 4. SSH Key Authentication (Original)
```bash
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py servers.txt
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py servers.txt --username admin
```
- Uses your existing SSH keys
- No password required
- Most secure option

## Authentication Flow

The tool now intelligently handles authentication:

1. **Password Authentication**: Uses sshpass or expect to test username/password
2. **Key Authentication**: Uses SSH keys from your system
3. **Fallback Support**: Automatically tries expect if sshpass unavailable
4. **Secure Input**: Passwords are hidden and not stored

## Installation Requirements

For password authentication, install one of these:

```bash
# Option 1: sshpass (recommended)
sudo apt-get install sshpass

# Option 2: expect (fallback)
sudo apt-get install expect
```

## Example Workplace Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test All Servers with Admin Account
```bash
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py company_servers.txt --interactive
# Enter: admin
# Enter: admin_password
```

Output:
```
✓ [1/10] web01.company.com     SUCCESS      (1.2s)
✓ [2/10] web02.company.com     SUCCESS      (1.5s)
⚠ [3/10] old-server.com        AUTH_FAILED  (2.1s)
```

### Scenario 2: Service Account Testing
```bash
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py servers.txt --username service_mon --password-auth
# Enter password for service_mon
```

### Scenario 3: Mixed Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test with SSH keys first
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py servers.txt --output key_results.txt

# Test failed servers with password auth
python3 server_connectivity_checker.py failed_servers.txt --interactive --output pwd_results.txt
```

## Status Codes with Authentication

| Status | SSH Keys | Username/Password |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| SUCCESS | Key authentication worked | Password authentication worked |
| AUTH_FAILED | No valid keys or access denied | Wrong username/password |
| PORT_CLOSED | SSH port blocked | SSH port blocked |
| DNS_FAILED | Hostname doesn't exist | Hostname doesn't exist |
| SSH_ERROR | SSH client issues | Missing sshpass/expect |

## Security Features

- **Secure Password Input**: Uses getpass for hidden password entry
- **No Password Storage**: Credentials used only during execution
- **Independent Connections**: Each server tested separately
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Automatically tries best available method

## Real-World Benefits

### For System Administrators
- Test service accounts across infrastructure
- Verify password changes propagated correctly
- Audit user access across server fleets
- Mix SSH key and password authentication as needed

### For Security Teams
- Validate account access patterns
- Test credential rotation effectiveness
- Audit authentication methods across environments
- Generate compliance reports with detailed results

### For DevOps Teams
- Verify deployment account access
- Test automation user credentials
- Check environment-specific access
- Integration with monitoring workflows

## Enhanced Output Example

```
Interactive mode: Please provide SSH credentials
Username: deploy_user
Password: [hidden]
Using password authentication for user: deploy_user

Loading server list from: production_servers.txt
Loaded 25 servers
Testing SSH access for user: deploy_user

Checking connectivity to 25 servers...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ [1/25] app01.prod.company.com    SUCCESS      (1.8s)
✓ [2/25] app02.prod.company.com    SUCCESS      (1.6s)
✓ [3/25] db01.prod.company.com     SUCCESS      (2.1s)
⚠ [4/25] legacy01.company.com      AUTH_FAILED  (3.2s)
✗ [5/25] decomm.company.com        DNS_FAILED   (0.1s)

SUMMARY:
  SUCCESS     : 22 (88.0%)  ← Can log in successfully
  AUTH_FAILED :  2 ( 8.0%)  ← Need password reset/access
  DNS_FAILED  :  1 ( 4.0%)  ← Server decommissioned
```
