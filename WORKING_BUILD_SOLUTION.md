# Rock Crush - Working Build Solution

## ✅ Status: Your System is Ready!
- ✅ `npx expo` works (version 0.24.20)
- ✅ `npx expo login` is functional
- ❌ EAS CLI blocked by npm registry (common network issue)

## Recommended Solution: Expo Web Dashboard

### Step 1: Login to Expo (You Already Started This)
When the login prompt appears:
1. **Enter your email** (same one you used to create Expo account)
2. **Enter your password**
3. **Press Enter**

### Step 2: Create Project ZIP File
Create a ZIP file with these files:
- `App.js`
- `app.json`
- `eas.json`
- `package-simple.json` (rename to `package.json` in ZIP)
- `src/` folder (complete)
- `assets/` folder (complete)

### Step 3: Use Expo Dashboard
1. **Go to**: https://expo.dev/
2. **Login** with same credentials
3. **Click**: "New Project"
4. **Upload your ZIP file**
5. **Configure build**:
   - Name: "Rock Crush"
   - Platform: Android
   - Build type: Production
6. **Start build**
7. **Wait 15-20 minutes**
8. **Download AAB file**

## Alternative: Test First, Build Later

### Verify Your Game Works
```bash
# This should already be running from earlier
npx expo start --web
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and verify:
- ✅ Game loads properly
- ✅ Rock matching works
- ✅ Audio plays correctly
- ✅ Premium/ads system functions
- ✅ All screens accessible

### Once Verified, Use Dashboard Build
This confirms your game is ready before building the AAB file.

## What Happens Next

### After Build Completes
1. **Download**: AAB file from Expo dashboard
2. **Upload**: To Google Play Console
3. **Configure**: Store listing with your prepared content

5. **Launch**: Your game goes live!
